## Contributing

Issues and pull requests of all sorts are welcome!

For bigger projects, please coordinate with [Gusztáv Szikszai](https://github.com/gdotdesign/) to make sure your changes get merged.

Please note that since I charge for Mint UI when companies are using it, this is a **commercial project** by me (Gusztáv Szikszai).
By sending pull requests, you agree that I can use your code changes in a commercial context.

Furthermore, also note that you **cannot redistribute** this project.
Please see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for what's allowed and what's not.

### Code setup

Clone the repo and run:

```console
mint install
```

To start a development server run:

```console
mint start
```

As a testbed, you can use the [website](https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-ui-website) project, or create temporary file with a `Main` component inside.
